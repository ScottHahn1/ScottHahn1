## Hi there üëã


## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a full-stack web developer who enjoys building clean, responsive applications using TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. 

What I love most about development is the creativity and problem-solving it involves ‚Äî there‚Äôs always more than one way to build something, which keeps things exciting and always a learning opportunity.

üß† I‚Äôm always striving to improve my skills, write cleaner code, and stay up-to-date with new tools and best practices in the ever-evolving world of web development.

üîç Currently open to full-time roles as a front-end or full-stack developer where I can contribute, learn from others, and grow as a developer.
